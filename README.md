# Video-Game-Sales-Data-Analysis

The video game market is a billion-dollar business that has a large and expanding fan base. This expanding sector
has grown in significance both commercially and poli􀆟cally. According to a business report by the Grand View
Research [1], in 2022 the global video game market size was es􀆟mated at USD 217.06 billion and is expected to
grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4% from 2023 to 2030. With the advancement of
technologies such as more powerful personal computers and other forms of digital devices, video games are now
more accessible, portable, and social for the users.
This report analyzes and focuses on video game sales from 2000 to 2009, especially in the North American video
game market. Then, we compare the North American video game market data with other markets, especially
with the video game market in Japan and the global video game market. We intend to examine the crucial
elements that determine a video game's success and how this success varies globally. We will cover the following
questons to guide our analysis:
 How do certain game atributes such as genre, platorm and publisher affect video games sales
worldwide?
 How do video game sales differ from region to region?
 How have video game sales been across the year from 2000 to 2009 and vary from region to region?
In additon, we will make a predicton regarding sales for a partcular genre for the years 2010 to 2019. After that
we will compare our predicted sales values with the actual historical values. To check how accurate our
predicton was.
The task is that I need to answer some business questons that will help game businesses to make decisions. To
do so, I need to analyze the data. I need to give some recommendatons to decision makers. To fulfill the
requirement of this given task, I need to present an in-depth analysis of the game business. For these reasons, I
have chosen to write a formal report.
